## TODO:
1. Using lazy load images is a plus but not mandatory.
2. The user must be able to type the category (like an auto-complete).
3. Multiple categories can be added (eg. tags).   /filter?tag=3d.mmorpg.fantasy.pvp&platform=pc
4. The state of the filter must remains when navigating between pages.
5. Unit test
